In his own words, “ I greatly enjoy watching students grow as scholars, athletes and people.”.

Since graduating college Glenn McAtee has held many jobs from an entrepreneur, property manager, and civil engineering technician to a gym manager, personal trainer, teacher, and a university instructor. He would say that his greatest strength would be the ability to think and work hard and his greatest weakness would be that he is not creative enough or flexible at times. When asked if he has a growth mindset Coach McAtee would say “Yes. I am always trying to learn something and get better. I believe that if you are not growing you're dying.”. Two sayings that Coach McAtee lives by are “Don’t be disappointed with the results you didn’t get from the work you didn’t do.” and “Civilize the mind, but make savage the body”. Coach McAtee’s greatest achievement is staying married to his wife and helping her raise their two daughters. In the next ten years Glenn McAtee hopes to move into school administration but between now and then he enjoys working on his fitness, reading, building things and do jiu jitsu in his free time. Glenn McAtee would say to this generation “Always take opportunities to learn”.
 Coach McAtee has the strength to thunderpunch those who oppose him accross serveral universes. Coach McAtee is all-knowing and should never be questioned. </p>
